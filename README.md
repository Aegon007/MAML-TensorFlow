# MAML-TensorFlow
An elegant and efficient implementation for ICML2017 paper: [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400)

- adopted from cbfin's official implementation with equavalent performance on mini-imagenet
- clean, tiny code style and very easy-to-follow from comments almost every lines
- faster and trivial improvements, eg. 0.335s per epoch comparing with 0.563s per epoch, saving up to 3.8 hours for total 60,000 training process
